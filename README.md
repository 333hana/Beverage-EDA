# Beverage-EDA

## STEP 1: ASK QUESTIONS
I was given two questions help me focus on relevant parts of data and direct analysis towards meaningful insights.
1.	Which drink has the highest calories from the dataset?
2.	Highest Sugar Drink ?

## STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA
Gather, Assess, Clean.
<ul>
  <li>Simply downloaded and imported data</li>
  <li>checked for potential issues relevant to my goal (answering questions)</li>
  <li>Didn't find duplicates.</li>
  <li> Replaced Null value as required.</li>
  <li> Dropped columns that will not direct analysis towards meaningful insights to answer questions.</li>
</ul>

## STEP 3: PERFORM EDA (EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS) 
Explored data to discover patterns and answers to posed questions.

## STEP 4: DRAW CONCLUSIONS 
After  visualizing and exploring data I was able to find answers to required questions mentioned in step 1, as well as few insights related to Sugar and calories in beverages which we were intrested in. Below each plot you will find my comment/conclusion.  
Pls refer to notebook for further details.
